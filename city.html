<h4>Summary</h4>
<p><img alt="Swansea castle" class="ImageFloatLeft" height="135" src="/ImportedImages/Schools/Artshums/ddh/Swansea-puff.jpg" width="224"/>A thriving port, a marcher base for the lords of Gower, and a multi-cultural urban community, Swansea was an important centre in the Middle Ages, comparable with many other historic European towns. Yet the medieval legacy of Swansea is almost invisible today. Wartime bombing and later re-development of the city centre, in particular, have almost completely obscured the traces of the medieval urban lay-out and its buildings. Currently, urban regeneration is fostering interest in Swansea's medieval heritage, driven by rescue archaeological work in the city and ongoing excavation / conservation projects on Swansea Castle. This project aims to further our understanding of medieval Swansea, to forge connections between the modern city and its medieval antecedent, and through digital mapping and textual analysis to reveal how medieval individuals from different cultural and ethnic communities understood and represented their town.</p>
<span><p>A unique research resource exists for medieval Swansea in the form of a fourteenth-century Vatican Library manuscript, which brings together witness testimonies describing the hanging of the Welshman 'William Cragh' by the lord of Gower in ?1289. This project aims to exploit the rich potential of this source to extend our understanding of the medieval town, by connecting it with GIS mapping and 3D digital visualisation, reconstructing the literal perspectives experienced by the medieval witnesses within the city, and exploring the diverse identities and perceptions of urban spaces which are represented in the text.</p>
