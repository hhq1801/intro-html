<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>'Discover Medieval Chester: Place, Heritage and Identity' is a project funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council under their Knowledge Transfer Fellowship Scheme.</p>
<p>'Discover Medieval Chester' builds on an earlier research project, 'Mapping Medieval Chester: place and identity in an English borderland city, c.1200-1500', and aims to share that research with new audiences in innovative and creative ways. At the heart of the project is a partnership between the academic team and the Grosvenor Museum, Chester.</p>
<p>The 'Discover Medieval Chester' project includes several core elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>a major new exhibition at the Grosvenor Museum, Chester, entitled 'Discover a Medieval City: Places, Voices, Journeys', which will then transfer to Wrexham Museum and later become a smaller permanent exhibition in Chester </li>
<li>the 'Discover Medieval Chester' website, with new interactive map, multi-media resources and user-generated tour feature, as well as the game and other materials</li>
<li>the 'Hryre' artwork at St John's ruins, created in collaboration with the artist Nayan Kulkarni and with additional funding from Cheshire West and Chester Council and Chester Renaissance</li>
<li>a series of paper brochures, offering a variety of tours of medieval Chester (including one version in a range of languages)</li>
<li>community events in Chester and beyond, sharing and developing our work in partnership with local people</li>
</ul>
