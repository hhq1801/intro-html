
<h3>Mapping the Medieval Countryside: Places, People, and Properties in the Inquisitions Post Mortem</h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Mapping the Medieval Countryside is a major research project dedicated to the modeling, analysis and online publication of medieval English inquisitions post mortem (IPMs).</p>
<p>These inquisitions, which recorded the lands held at their deaths by tenants of the crown, comprise the most extensive and important body of source material for landholding in medieval England. They describe the lands held by thousands of families, from nobles to peasants, and are a key source for the history of almost every settlement in England (and of many in Wales). They are indispensable to local and family historians as well as to academic specialists in areas as diverse as agrarian history and political society.</p>
<p>The project will publish a searchable English translation of a selection of IPMs, in addition to piloting a model for more detailed analysis and mapping of the inquisitions’ contents, and in so doing establish a transferable methodology and framework for editing and publishing the IPMs – integrating text, historical entity management, semantic tagging, statistical analysis and geospatial data – using innovative historical tools and methodologies developed in the field of digital humanities.</p>
