<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>A unique manuscript from ninth-century Northumbria with later additions made at Durham Cathedral Priory. The Durham Liber Vitae is a complex manuscript which originated in the mid-ninth-century as a list of several hundred names of persons associated with a Northumbrian church, probably Lindisfarne, but possibly Monkwearmouth/Jarrow. The manuscript was digitized to support research into social, economic, religious history across north-east England over six centuries.</p>
