<h3>Profile of a Doomed Elite: The Structure of English Landed Society in 1066</h3>
<h4>Project URL</h4>No public website at present  <h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Profile of a Doomed Elite is using innovative methods for interpreting Domesday Book to survey the whole of English landed society on the eve of the Norman Conquest in 1066, identifying landowners at all levels of society from the king and earls down to the parish gentry and even some prosperous peasants. </p>
<p>It may seem astonishing that this has never been done before, since the evidence has existed for more than 900 years. Domesday Book is the most complete survey of any medieval landed society, and provides a unique opportunity to reconstruct the distribution of landed wealth in eleventh-century England. It has been intensively studied, but until now progress has been blocked: the way pre-Conquest landholders are recorded creates major difficulties in identifying and distinguishing individuals of the same name; gathering, comparing, and mapping the evidence by hand has been prohibitively time-consuming; and evidence about landholders in other sources (such as chronicles and charters) has not been systematically pulled together. </p>
<p>However the existence of The Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England (PASE) allows the evidence to be assembled, mapped, and compared with other sources much more efficiently. PASE provides a prosopography – that is, a list of everything known – for every person recorded throughout the entire Anglo-Saxon period from the sixth century to the eleventh. ‘Profile of a Doomed Elite’ builds on and refine PASE’s coverage of the late Anglo-Saxon nobility on the eve of its demise. It opens up the prospect of a major breakthrough in our knowledge of the Norman Conquest, one of the defining moments in English and European history. </p>
<p>The project makes innovative use of GIS mapping tools both for analysis and data visualisation. These analytical maps form part of the digital outputs of the project, all of which will be integrated into the PASE website and published online there. </p>
