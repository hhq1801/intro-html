<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Inscriptiones antiquae Orae Septentrionalis Ponti Euxini graecae et<br/>
latinae (IOSPE) is a five-year project currently funded by the A.G.<br/>
Leventis Foundation and the Loeb Classical Library Foundation to study,<br/>
edit and publish in both English and Russian print and online editions<br/>
the ancient Greek and Latin inscriptions from the Northern Coast of the<br/>
Black Sea, an area comprising modern Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and<br/>
Russia. We distinguish four geopolitical areas and four corresponding<br/>
collections: (I) Tyras and its vicinity, (II) Olbia and its vicinity,<br/>
(III) Chersonesos and western, southern, and central Crimea, and (IV)<br/>
Bosporus. Each collection is further divided into fascicles based on<br/>
geographic, linguistic, or chronological criteria, whichever apply<br/>
within that area. Byzantine inscriptions constitute a separate<br/>
collection covering the entire region. The first stage of the project<br/>
involves publication of Lapidary Inscriptions. There will be about 5,000<br/>
lapidary texts published in IOSPE, about three times as many as in the<br/>
original 1885-1901 corpus. Texts range in length from single words to<br/>
several dozen lines depending on their genre (e.g., decrees of state,<br/>
funerary inscriptions), their state of preservation, and the possibility<br/>
of restoring missing text on the basis of other sources.</p>
