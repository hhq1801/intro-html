<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The Roma Villa of Oplontis, located near Pompeii, was substantially excavated from 1964 through the early eighties. In terms of size, architectural layout, and the range and quality of its paintings and mosaics it is arguably the most important Roman imperial villa ever to come to light. Yet the excavated portions, comprising some 90 discrete spaces ranging from small rooms to a 60 meter swimming pool, still await any comprehensive publication. The Oplontis Project is a large-scale international collaboration undertaking the first systematic and interdisciplinary study of the site. It is led by Prof. John Clarke who has assembled a large expert team to study the villa's construction history, changes in function, social history, material culture, and ensembles of decoration. The project has 3 Collaborators: The Italian Ministry of Culture, the University of Texas at Austin, and the King's Visualisation Labe. KVL are charged with responsibility for preparing a highly detailed 3D computer model of the entire site. The objectives of our work are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>To prepare a detailed digital scan of the site, recording complex data for both the spatial configuration of almost 100 rooms, as well high resolution photographic images of all the wall, ceilings and floor surfaces and decoration. </div>
</li>
<li>
<div>To prepare from this a 3D computer model of the existing state, and to link this to the extensive databases newly created by the Project as well as its extensive unpublished archives.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>To hold a series of workshops on the work of the Project, and at its conclusion to contribute to the first comprehensive publication of the entire site.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>To also prepare an interactive model hypothetically restoring the site, including representations of furnishings, lighting, gardens and sculpture and to enable users to access and interact with this through an online virtual world. </div>
</li>
</ul>
