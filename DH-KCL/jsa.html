<h4>Summary</h4>
<dl><dt>The Jonathan Swift Archive makes available digitized texts of Jonathan Swift’s prose works, transcribed from a great variety of early printed editions. The archive is an electronic supplement to the printed Cambridge Works of Jonathan Swift , 18 vols. (Cambridge University Press, 2008-). <br/><br/>Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) is remembered today as a poet, satirist and political writer. He was also a clergyman in the Church of Ireland, and Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin between 1713 and his death in 1745. Although he was a prolific writer and publisher – as a journalist, political pamphleteer, historian, and writer on religious matters – the canon of his works is dominated by three famous texts: A Tale of a Tub (1704), Gulliver's Travels (1726) and A Modest Proposal (1729). Many commentators consider them to be the supreme expressions of the satirical mode in the English language.</dt><dd>The archive project is a collaboration between Keele University (host institution) and the University of Oxford, with technical consultancy from the Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London. The editors of the archive are Paddy Bullard, Daniel Cook, and Adam Rounce, in association with James McLaverty and David Womersley. From 2010 the archive manager is Paddy Bullard.</dd><dd>
