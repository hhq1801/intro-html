<h4>Summary</h4>
<dl><dt>The Project investigated Pompeian wall paintings by using digital 3D visualisation to create three-dimensional models of the stage structures they seem to depict. The digital reconstruction of the rooms where the paintings were originally displayed, and the restoration of their decorative schemes, allowed the analysis of the relationships between these rooms and paintings within the architectural ensemble of particular houses, and the discussion on how they may have been perceived and experienced by ancient spectators.</dt><dd>
