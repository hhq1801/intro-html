<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The records of early drama, secular music and ceremonial in London are numerous and ubiquitous, but often incidental to the declared purpose of the document containing them. Consequently many have never been identified, and those which are known have often only a fragmentary cultural, historical, or even physical context to permit proper interpretation. In conjunction with the preparation of the REED edition of records of pre-1642 dramatic activity exhibited by the eight early Middlesex/Westminster theatres north of the Thames, LTB aims to provide a widely-available aggregated bibliography which locates, assesses, and digests all later printed transcriptions of pre-1642 documents relating to these theatres. </p>
