<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This project develops an innovative approach to Roman sculpture by interpreting techniques through the lens of practical craft expertise. It will digitize and catalogue a unique and unpublished slide collection documenting Roman stone carving. It goes beyond conventional projects by using these images as the basis for systematic research into the relationship between tools and their marks, craftsmen and their materials. The output will constitute an online resource providing access to the core dataset. This will be integrated with analytical commentaries and new synthetic studies on the process of carving based on rigorous academic study and applied knowledge of making.</p>
