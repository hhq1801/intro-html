<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Mapping Migration in Kastoria, Macedonia was a pilot project which sought to construct a Geographical Information System (GIS) and web-site focussing on the forced migration of people from 1880 to the present day in the geographical region of Macedonia now known as the district of Kastoria, Greece. The content of the web site is drawn from a collection of material consisting of historical documents, photographs (both contemporary and historical), postcards, short explanatory texts, demographic metadata in databases concerning about one hundred and twenty communities and multimedia presentations of places, historical events and cultural phenomena.</p>
