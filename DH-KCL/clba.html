<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>An investigation of the cultural expressions of, and responses to, the history of the black diaspora within the Lusophone Atlantic triangle; that is, the transnational movements of people and traditions, the dialogues and exchanges that have occurred between the societies of Portugal, Africa and Brazil from the beginning of the slave trade until the present day. Research focused on case studies of literature, language, music, dance, festivals, religion, cultural and political movements and ideas which exemplify the multi-directional relations connecting the three corners of the Lusophone Atlantic. A concentrated body of research for publication arose from the addressing of three major thematic areas deemed to constitute the conceptual framework of the Lusophone Black Atlantic - Movements and migrations, Cultural and artistic practices, and Cultural Politics.</p>
