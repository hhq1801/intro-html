<h3>The Cult of Saints in Wales: Medieval Welsh Language Sources and Their Transmission</h3>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p style="line-height: normal;">The AHRC are funding a research project on Medieval Welsh-language sources and their transmission. The project is led by the University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh &amp; Celtic Studies, with King’s College London’s Department of Digital Humanities, University of Wales: Trinity St David and the National Library of Wales. The research grant will support a four year research project on medieval Welsh language literature devoted to the veneration of saints.</p>
<p style="line-height: normal;">Study of the origins, nature and development of saints' cults is flourishing internationally, but the Welsh sources are at best partially known: some texts have never been edited, others languish in inaccessible publications, and many are available only to Welsh-speakers. The project will create a digital research platform providing a basis for comparative study of this significant tradition.</p>
<p style="line-height: normal;">The Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London (led by Co-Investigator Miguel Vieira) is leading on digital sustainability and the evolving form of the digital edition, developing the Department’s Open Source scholarly publication framework <a class="sys_16" href="https://github.com/kcl-ddh/kiln">'Kiln'</a> into an innovative editing and publishing platform for digitally enabled scholarship.</p>
<h4>Start date</h4>
