<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The images in this collection are digital reproductions of the black and white photographs taken of the original Foundling Hospital as it stood in Coram's Fields before it was demolished in 1926. This photographic record was used to allow the designers of the Museum to incorporate original features taken from the Hospital and to lay out the rooms as they had been.</p>
