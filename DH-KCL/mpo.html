<h4>Project URL</h4><a class="sys_16" href="http://mpol.cch.kcl.ac.uk/">http://mpol.cch.kcl.ac.uk/</a>  <h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Freemasonry is the world’s oldest secular, fraternal organisation. The first Grand Lodge was formed in London in 1717 and was one example of the development of associational life beginning in the eighteenth century which is considered critical to the development of modern, industrial society. There are an increasing number of references to freemasonry in English magazines and newspapers but, from the end of the eighteenth century up to the present day, various series of periodicals began to be published in London primarily by and for a Masonic audience. </p>
<p>These publications are important sources not only for understanding the issues within freemasonry but for providing information about the individuals involved and the localities where lodges were based. Few complete series of these periodicals are held in libraries and they have only limited indexes. <br/>This project aims to make this material more widely available and searchable, and will, on completion, provide searchable digital copies of the major Masonic English language publications. </p>
