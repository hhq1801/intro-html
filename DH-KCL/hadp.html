<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Edward Alleyn was the Elizabethan actor-manager who founded Dulwich College; with his father-in-law Philip Henslowe he ran several of the most successful acting companies of Shakespeare's time, including the Lord Admiral's Men, and expanded a number of London theatres, among them the Rose. The Henslowe-Alleyn Archive (held at at Dulwich College) consists of over 2000 pages of fragile manuscripts comprising the most important extant archive of material relating to drama and performance in the early modern period.</p>
<p>The Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project, co-sponsored by the University of Reading and King's College London's Centre for Computing in the Humanities, will make the single largest manuscript collection on early modern English theatre production and performance available as an electronic archive and website.</p>
