<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Aims to promote the study of music as performance through a specific focus on recordings. Its activities include a major discographic project, seminars and research projects. <br/><br/>Traditionally, music has been studied as a text reproduced in performance - almost as if it were an obscure kind of literature. By placing performance at the centre of musicology - by promoting a musicology based on recordings and not just scores - CHARM aims to reduce the gulf between musicology and the listener. CHARM addresses three fundamental problems: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>the difficulty of accessing early recordings</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>the dispersal of knowledge about recordings </div>
</li>
<li>
<div>the need to develop analytical approaches to recordings</div>
</li>
</ul>
