<h4>Summary</h4>
A project to build a 20 million-word lexicographical database of international varieties of Spanish in the 1990s and to make the results available to scholars on the desktop. The first module, comprising approximately 5.25 million words of Castilian Spanish, has been completed and was published on CD-ROM in 1995. The text is marked up to indicate basic bibliographical information and other facts about the text that may be of significance to scholars: page and paragraph changes, typographical and other features. It is designed to be used with the text-analysis program TACT, developed by John Bradley at the University of Toronto (Canada).  <br/>
