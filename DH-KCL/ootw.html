<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The Out of the Wings online database will make information about Spanish language plays available to English-speaking theatre professionals - practitioners and researchers alike - providing sample translations and facilities for user-focused content creation. </p>
<p>The digital framework under development will reveal the plays as well as the bodies of knowledge that inform and sustain professional practice within Hispanic cultures. In this way, users will be able to access the type of information that will open up the theatre to their interests and purpose. Users will be able to search through a comprehensive database of Spanish-language plays (either generically under Golden Age, Modern Spanish and Spanish American or by key words - genre, type of play, number of characters, theme, etc.) to find the play or plays that are relevant to their own programming or research needs. The entries of individual plays will all be contextualised through synopsis, sample translation, production notes, critical responses and performance history, and a final section will guide users towards a directory of theatre translators. </p>
<p>The technical framework being developed uses well-accepted standards for modelling data at a conceptual level and might serve as a useful reference point for other research involving translation or performance studies. </p>
