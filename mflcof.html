<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Medievalists are well aware that French was used widely outside French-speaking areas of the kingdom of France throughout the high Middle Ages. Texts in French were widely disseminated and there were substantial indigenous francophone textual traditions outside the borders of France. However, the agendas set by 19th-c. nationalist literary historians have proved tenacious and if some areas of francophone literary culture outside France, principally Anglo- Norman, have been the subject of sustained research, the 'Frenchness' of texts written in French has in practice rarely been questioned. As a result, the nature and extent of the dissemination of French culture and francophone literary traditions outside France remains under-researched and imprecisely calibrated. </p>
<p>The project focuses upon 6 major francophone textual traditions from the 12th and 13th c. that have a pan European dissemination in the 13th and 14th c., as well as strong legacies of translations/adaptations in other languages: the Roman d'Alexandre, the Roman de Troie, the Lancelot and Tristan en prose, the Roman de la Rose and Brunetto Latini's Trésor. Our aim is to map, insofar and as accurately as is possible, the dissemination of these texts by determining the provenance of surviving manuscripts, and their trajectory. Because traditional scholarship has been largely concerned with the establishment of authoritative 'originals' and generally been less interested in what becomes of texts as they are transmitted, this new research aims to reveal a considerable body of hitherto occluded data on the dissemination of francophone literary culture.</p>
<ul>
<li> In what social and cultural milieus were francophone texts composed and disseminated outside France? </li>
<li> Is there a transnational francophone literary culture, and how does it vary? </li>
<li> Does the focus and form of medieval francophone literary texts change as they migrate? </li>
<li> Do sites of production and transmission outside France influence literary traditions in France? </li>
<li> Does literary French imply a cultural identity? If so, is this necessarily associated with France? </li>
<li> Should cultural identities be reconceived as mobile, produced by movement as much as by place? </li>
<li> What is the cultural freight of non-standard and hybrid forms of French? </li>
<li> How do non-standard forms influence our understanding of what French is? </li>
<li> Are there implications for literary history? </li>
</ul>
