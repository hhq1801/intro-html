<h4>Project URL</h4><a class="sys_16" href="http://blog.jainpedia.org">http://blog.jainpedia.org</a>  <h4>Summary</h4>Jainpedia is a searchable online database of digitised cultural artefacts, a unique 'encyclopaedia' and library of Jainism, and an interactive community space for British Jains. <br/><br/>Jainpedia will be a free world-leading resource on the web. It offers translations and transcriptions of selected texts and a wealth of contextual information about the Jain religion and its host society in India. <br/><br/>The Jainpedia team is leading the digitisation of approximately 4,000 pages of the thousands of Jain manuscripts and Jain objects in the United Kingdom. The involvement of eminent academics and volunteers from the Jain community in the project highlights how the expertise and enthusiasm of different groups can work together to produce a valuable resource for all. <br/><br/>DDH is the technical partner on this project, led by the London-based Institute of Jainology. Each item is being digitised to international digital curation standards and stored in an image database. The website is built around the Drupal content management system and is designed to display the images in a copyright-protected environment that allows viewers to appreciate their beauty, craftsmanship and religious significance.  <h4>Start Date</h4>September 2009  <h4>Status</h4>In progress  <h4>Participants</h4>
