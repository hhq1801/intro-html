<h4>Summary</h4>
The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Ben Jonson is an international project that has been in progress for over a decade, involving nearly fifty contributors from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa, Italy, and Australia, under the general editorship of Professors David Bevington, Martin Butler, and Ian Donaldson. In addition to the print edition (to be published by Cambridge University Press in 2011), which will comprise some 2.3 million words, an online scholarly digital edition is also being prepared, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon foundation and with technical research and development carried out by the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at King's College London. In addition to critically-edited modern-spelling text and apparatus, this edition will offer the old-spelling texts, and digitized images of the major manuscripts and all the folio, quarto and octavo texts printed in Jonson’s lifetime. Complementing these are also archives containing the documentary materials necessary for study of Jonson: the Life Records, the Masque Records, the Literary Record, a Dubia, a Performance Archive, a Music Edition, a Library List (detailing the scores of books surviving from Jonson’s library, and their annotations), supplementary essays, and a full on-line Bibliography. This material – in quantity, more than four times the length of the Print Edition – will be fully searchable, enabling a comprehensive study of Jonson in relation to his life, texts, times, and afterlife.
