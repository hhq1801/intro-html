<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>V-Must -- Virtual Museums Transnational Network of Excellence -- is sponsored by the European Commission as part of the Framework 7 Research Programme with funding of over four and a half million Euros. It is a four year project, that commenced in February 2011, and consists of 18 core partners and a large number of associated partners and expert advisors drawn variously from the academic, cultural heritage, and ICT development communities. It aims to consolidate and greatly advance a very wide range of both existing and future initiatives in the broad area of virtual museum projects and products whether located at museums, galleries, heritage sites, or online as websites or "virtual worlds". It will bridge technological domains, archival, social and cognitive sciences to advance state-of-the-art digital preservation, for VM's future persistence. It will create a virtual research area; identify research areas for further development; identify and support future standards and platforms for VMs of the Future; increase the competitiveness of the EU-ICT industry; create a quality evaluation procedure; and support the development of extensive programmes of training in the area of virtual museums within both the cultural heritage sector and in European higher education. KVL as a core participant leads the programme of courses, training, mobility, and higher education for the Network. </p>
