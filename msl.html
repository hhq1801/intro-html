<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Students studying Shakespeare often complain that the playwright’s work is remote from the time and place they live in. The aim of this project is to enhance students’ understanding of Shakespeare by showing them that the city in which most of his great plays were written is still alive and well on their very own doorsteps. This project will help students to understand the context in which the plays were written, through the historical mapping of Shakespeare’s city. The violence of Titus Andronicus begins to seem more understandable when students recognize the gruesome capital punishments and blood sports witnessed by everyday Londoners, for instance. The Inns of Court, which provided an early performance venue for Shakespeare’s plays, and whose legal concerns are evident in Measure for Measure and The Merchant of Venice, continue to thrive right next to King’s. This project will directly impact upon students’ study of the plays by visibly charting the place out of which they grew, and showing them that they are not so remote as they might seem from present-day London. <br/><br/>This innovative project is designed as a learning and teaching tool to support students on the “Shakespeare in London” MA module. When complete it will be published as a fully searchable online map of the London in which William Shakespeare lived and worked, generating new insight into the plays written in that city, and encouraging undergraduates to present their independent research in a compelling way to the wider public.</p>
