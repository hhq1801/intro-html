<h4>Summary</h4>

<div>
<p>The project was based in the Department of English at King's College London, and was a component of the Historical Thesaurus Project based at the University of Glasgow. The project's aim was to create records of all Old English words, and allocate them to appropriate subject headings, using a multi-level hierarchy of subject terms. <br/><br/>The DDH role was to carry out the analysis needed to create and refine a relational database that was used by the researchers to enter and subsequently to edit the words, the subject term hierarchy and the classifications that linked words to terms. At the end of the project, DDH created the scripts that produced the camera-ready copy for the publication of the thesaurus in print. It was first published in two volumes as: Jane Roberts, Christian Kay with Lynne Grundy: A Thesaurus of Old English, King's College London, London Medieval Studies XI (1995). There was a subsequent second impression published, with the same authors and title, also in two volumes, by Rodolfi in 2000. <br/><br/>The database itself was given to the University of Glasgow, who included it in their Historical Thesaurus project. This led to the publication of the Historical Thesaurus of the OED by OUP in 2009.
