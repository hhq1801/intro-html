<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Research tool for locating and analysing records relating to Anglican clerical careers from the Reformation to the mid-nineteenth century, holding over 1.5 million evidence records, each recording an individual event in the career of a clergyman or schoolteacher, and supporting documentation. The significance of the Church of England in understanding religion, politics, government, society and the regions in England and Wales derives from its artistic, scientific, administrative, political and economic activity. <br/><br/>The Clergy of the Church of England Database (CCEd) is a collaborative project, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and bringing together scholars from King's College London, the University of Kent at Canterbury and the University of Reading. The online publication is based on the first phase of the project 1999-2005. A second phase, funded by AHRC 2005-2008, is creating a publication in which it will be possible to chart the careers of individual clergymen. <br/><br/>This website not only gives access to the Database, but also provides a range of supporting materials about the Church and its clergy.</p>
