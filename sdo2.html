<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Schenker Documents Online is a digital edition of three large collections of personal documents of Viennese musician and teacher Heinrich Schenker (1868-1935). </p>
<p>The twentieth century's leading theorist of tonal music, Schenker produced a series of innovative studies and editions between 1903 and 1935 and left behind a voluminous archive of correspondence, diaries and lessonbooks. Edited in near-diplomatic transcription and with English translations, these materials form the core of the edition, supported by additional documents relating to his life, and a set of "profiles" of people, places and organizations with which he came into contact. </p>
<p>This third phase of the project, running throughout 2011–2013, will focus primarily on the period October 1925 to September 1930, the period in which Schenker arrived at the final formulation of his theory. Emphasis will be placed on Schenker's correspondence with the third of his three main publishing houses, Drei Masken Verlag of Munich, with the engravers Waldheim-Eberle of Vienna, and with those involved in their publication of Das Meisterwerk in der Musik (Otto Erich Deutsch, Alfred Einstein, and others). Funding was obtained from the Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council of Great Britain for this phase.</p>
