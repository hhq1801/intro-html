<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The Scottish Wars of Independence created a new and fundamental divide in the north of Britain. The project seeks to investigate the divergent views by modern historians about the significance of this divide by by focusing on the key elements of society and identity. To gain a fresh understanding of society, the critical mass of detail that is required for researching social structures and patterns will be achieved by creating two free-access web-based resources. The first is an extension of the database of the 'Paradox of Medieval Scotland, 1093-1286' (PoMS) to embrace all individuals and their social interactions recorded in documents relating to Scotland 1286-1314. The second is a new database of all information about all individuals in extant royal records relating to Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland for the three northern counties of England in English Royal Records 1216-1307. Both will be interlinked, and will be designed to be fruitful for scholars and informative for beginners. </p>
