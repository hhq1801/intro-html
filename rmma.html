<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The aim of this project is to explore how, in the age of online publication, reliable information can be exchanged and exploited between researchers in different areas. It is an exercise in working out how to set up a dialogue/discussion to which a range of specialists and scholars could contribute. <br/><br/>We have selected the area of medieval medical knowledge, because we know that there is a a great deal of important work going on in this area, much of which is focussed on particular areas and language groups. The challenge, as we see it, is to establish a shared resource which could be used by historians of medicine in the Latin west, the Greek East, the Arab-speaking world and other adjacent cultures.</p>
