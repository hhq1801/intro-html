<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>In 2004, the Centre for Computing in the Humanities began a pilot project in collaboration with the Department of Spanish and Spanish-American studies at King’s College London to explore the extent to which some of the traditional scholarly research activities associated with an academic department could be represented using an XML-based architecture. The principle aim was to create a resource that integrated primary sources with scholarly commentary within an environment that allowed users to re-arrange materials according to different points of focus: the scholars involved; the authors of the primary source materials; the research areas or thematic bibliographies. <br/> <br/> The project focused on one of the major research areas in the Department of Spanish and Spanish-American studies, namely the literature, culture and history of the Spanish Golden Age, but the underlying goal was that the framework developed could be re-applied to any academic department wishing to publish its research within an integrated environment. <br/> <br/> Early Modern Spain brings together the work of a number of scholars at King’s College London and related institutions, all of whom work on aspects of the Spanish Golden Age, focusing particularly on Cervantes, origins of the novel, food and culture, Anglo-Spanish literary relations, and the literary impact of the discovery of the New World.</p>
