<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Linguistic Geographies aims to help explain how maps were produced in the Middle Ages. Very little is known of the processes that were involved in medieval map-making, yet as visual objects maps such as the one which is the focus of this study – the Gough Map of Great Britain – they continue to fascinate and mystify modern audiences. The Gough Map is the earliest to show the whole of Britain in geographically-recognizable form, and is conventionally dated to c.1360.</p>
<p>Yet, despite its appearance in television programmes, book covers, learned articles and so forth, the Gough Map’s origins are uncertain, including who made it, how, where and why? This project seeks to address these questions by using an innovative approach to explore the map’s ‘linguistic geographies’, that is the writing used on the map by the (unknown) scribes who created it. This technique involves specialist palaeographic and linguistic skills that are normally applied to text manuscripts, but with this project they are being tried on a map manuscript, somewhat experimentally, with the aim of not only finding more about the Gough Map’s making but also the transferability of particular methods from linguistic to cartographic history.</p>
<p>One of the main project outcomes is a web resource through which the Gough Map will be made more widely accessible (it currently resides in the Bodleian Library), and through which the data and findings of this project will be made freely available. This will help others to develop the research, whether in academic or non-academic sectors. The project will provide the basis for a public exhibition on the Gough Map, to be held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, at which a 3-day colloquium will provide a forum for discussion on the language and linguistics of medieval maps and mapping. </p>
